# Installation

These are very experimental post-install scripts, they will remove some
programs, install other, disable bluetooth, wifi etc... this might not
be what everybody wants, then it's required to study and tweak the
scripts before execution. :-P
```
git clone https://github.com/hotnuma/sysconfig.git
